In this project I am analyzing how retails and marketing business works by focusing on:
1. Consumer behaviour
2. Market entry and post-entry strategy
3. Inventory optimisation
4. Market basket analysis 

OList is a e-commerce company that has faced some losses recently and
they want to manage their inventory very well so as to reduce any unnecessary costs that they might be bearing and understanding the root cause.

I will be using methods likes Apriori Trick, Pareto Analysis, Cross-sell as it will help in identifing top products that contribute to the revenue and also helping in creating market basket to analyze the purchasing behavior of individual customer to estimate with relative certainty, what items are more likely to be purchased individually or in combination with some other products.

I have used jupyter notebook and python programming language for data cleaning and EDA. The Libraries numpy,pandas,matplotlib,seaborn. And for visualization tool : Tableau.
