In this project I am analyzing how retails and marketing business works by focusing on:
1. Consumer behaviour
2. Market entry and post-entry strategy
3. Inventory optimisation
4. Market basket analysis 

And by understanding from these factors, it will help in identifing top products that contribute to the revenue and also by using market basket analysis to analyze the purchasing behavior of individual customer to estimate with relative certainty, what items are more likely to be purchased individually or in combination with some other products.

I have used jupyter notebook and python programming language for data cleaning and EDA. The Libraries numpy,pandas,matplotlib,seaborn. And for visualization tool : Tableau.
